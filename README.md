# UserAuthenticationSystem #
- Using a lot of console logs, to show the power it has, when gathering data in development

# Dependencies
- Check package.json file.
- for database storage I used MySQL Workbench 8.0

# Application
to start use in terminal: 'npm start' - in browser the main page is 'http://localhost:3000/'.
- feel free to sign up a new 'User' for login, after test if deletion of user is required, use the program 'Postman'.
  the setup is 'DELETE' and 'http://localhost:3000/users/*', ( if user 1 or 2 or so wants to deleted set the right 'id' where the star is /*)

  CRUD is implemented!
  ---- 
- This application is implemented and secured with passportJS and it uses sessions!

----

check the terminal for the different logs implemented in the code!

Have fun!:D
